      <description>What up homies!
My name is Justin, I&amp;rsquo;m from California.
I realized at some point years ago I love to travel and explore, even if just to the other end of town on a longboard.
Apart from a couple family trips, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t traveled much until I went to Costa Rica to study abroad in 2012. It was an amazing experience. I lived with a local Costa Rican family for 4 months and immersed myself into their culture.</description>

      <description>EEEvery time I travel, I overpack something
Normally its a shirt I thought I&amp;rsquo;d wear but didn&amp;rsquo;t or even a pair of shoes or extra bar of soap
On my most recent trip, I packed a medium school-sized backpack with enough stuff for 3 weeks in Costa Rica. I knew from past trips that on the coast in February, its very warm day and night and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wear a shirt much since most days I would be surfing or at a festival.</description>
